# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.
2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
3. Define the start and goal locations.
4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.
5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].
7. Write it up.
8. Congratulations!  Your Done!

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.

### Explain the Starter Code

#### 1. Explain the functionality of what's provided in `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`
These scripts contain a basic planning implementation that includes...

And here's a lovely image of my results (ok this image has nothing to do with it, but it's a nice example of how to include images in your writeup!)

### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm

#### 1. Set your global home position
Here students should read the first line of the csv file, extract lat0 and lon0 as floating point values and use the self.set_home_position() method to set global home. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.


And here is a lovely picture of our downtown San Francisco environment from above!

#### 2. Set your current local position
The starter code assumed the drone takes off from map center, but the drone need to be able to takeoff from anywhere. 

I retreived the drone's current position in geodetic coordinates from `self.global_position`, and the global home position set from last step from `self.global_home`, then used the utility function `global_to_local()` to convert the current global position to local position.

I did this in [line 132](motion_planning.py#L132) of `motion_planning.py`.


#### 3. Set grid start position from local position
The starter code hardcoded the map center as the start point for planning. To further enhance the flexibility to the start location, I changed this to be the current local position in [line 142 to 144](motion_planning.py#L142-L144) of `motion_planning.py`.


#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords
The starter code hardcoded the goal position as some location 10 m north and 10 m east of map center. To add flexibility to the desired goal location, I modified the code in [line 148 to 151](motion_planning.py#L148-L151) of `motion_planning.py` to accept arbitrary goal postion on the grid given any geodetic coordinates. By defaults I set the coordinates to (longitude, latitude, altitude). 

To assign the goal position, use command line arguments `goal_lon` for longitude, `goal_lat` for latitude, and `goal_alt` for altitude. For example:

```
python motion_planning.py --goal_lat 37.792945 --goal_lon -122.397513 --goal_alt 26
``` 

#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)
I updated the A* implementation to include diagnoal motions on the grid that have a cost of sqrt(2). With diagnoal motions included, the jerky movement disappeared and the trajectories planned for the same goal changed. I did this in [lines 58 to 61](planning_utils.py#L58-L61), [91 to 98](planning_utils.py#L91-L98) of `planning_utils.py`.

Here's a comparison between paths with and without diagonal motion:

#### 6. Cull waypoints 
To prune the path of unnecessary waypoints, I implemented collinearity test in [lines 167 to 188](planning_utils.py#L167-L188) of `planning_utils.py` and applied it to the path obtained from A* search.

Here's a comparison between paths before and after removing the unnecessary waypoints:

### Execute the flight
#### 1. Does it work?
It works!

### Double check that you've met specifications for each of the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) points.
  
# Extra Challenges: Real World Planning

For an extra challenge, consider implementing some of the techniques described in the "Real World Planning" lesson. You could try implementing a vehicle model to take dynamic constraints into account, or implement a replanning method to invoke if you get off course or encounter unexpected obstacles.
